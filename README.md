# food_demo base on Codeigniter PHP
It is just demo that I finished in few hours, I have not much time to finish the full scope of this demo.
Please create new database and import tables follow demo_database.sql

Then you should update your database config at: application/config/database.php
& update your base URL at here: 
 + application/config/config.php : $config['base_url'] = '';
 
Thank you for your reading!
